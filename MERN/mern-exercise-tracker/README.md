# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the project

To run the project, you need to get permission from the owner of the cluster to allow your ip to make requests. Once this is done you can:
1. Go to the backend directory and run :
 `nodemon server.js`\
This will connect your application to the backend

2. Go to the src directory and run:  `yarn start`\
Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\
The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
