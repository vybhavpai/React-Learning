# React-Learning
My experiments with React framework, this is the path I followed:
1. May 03, 2021: Started with the [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
2. May 07, 2021: After completing the tutorial, there were a few challenges put across at the [end](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#wrapping-up) of the tutorial.
3. May 11, 2021: Completed the challenges and started reading some [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html).
