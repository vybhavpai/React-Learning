# React-Learning
My experiments with React framework, this is the path I followed:
1. May 03, 2021: Started with the [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
2. May 07, 2021: After completing the tutorial, there were a few challenges put across at the [end](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#wrapping-up) of the tutorial.
3. May 11, 2021: Completed the challenges and started reading some [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html).
4. May 17, 2021: Followed a [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M) and learnt about building a website with frontend and back end using MERN stack. MERN stands for 
   - MongoDB  - the backend for our website is stored in MongoDB, which is a database. Most people use the mongoose library with MongoDB, so as to help them in structuring the way data is sent and received from the backend.
   - Express  - It is a JavaScript Library which simplifies the process of making a server.
   - React    - Library used to design the front end.   
   - Node.js  - Library to run javascript code.
  
    One nice thing about the Tutorial was it taught how to use a cluster on the cloud to store all your data.
    
    **Important** to note that there is an [updated version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrHNSanmqQ4) of the tutorial, maybe you can check that out. 
5. May 19, 2021: After learning a bit about MERN, I started exploring Javascript, Node.js in particular. Followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlB_eWDSMt4) tutorial on Node.
6. May 20, 2021: Before I went on to go ahead and start building my own project, i felt i needed to do a course on MERN stack. So after doing a bit of research I picked [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/mern-stack-front-to-back/learn/lecture/10055132#overview) course. The tutors name is Brad traversy and he has alot of good content on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA) as well. 
7. May 21, 2021: When I started of the course, the tutor suggested to take his [crash course on React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8) if one didnt have the basics of React figure out. I started the course, and completed it over the course of a few days. The crash course had quite good content and gave me a good vibe about the tutor. The tutor covered quite a few basic topics in react like components, routing etc, he also taught about json server which can function as a mock back end.
8. May 24, 2021: Completed the Crash course, where we made a small project which was a task tracker. Following this I started the course on the Following Day.
