# React-Learning
My experiments with React framework, this is the path I followed:
1. May 03, 2021: Started with the [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
2. May 07, 2021: After completing the tutorial, there were a few challenges put across at the [end](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#wrapping-up) of the tutorial.
3. May 11, 2021: Completed the challenges and started reading some [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html).
4. May 17, 2021: Followed a [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M) and learnt about building a website with frontend and back end using MERN stack. MERN stands for 
   - MongoDB  - the backend for our website is stored in MongoDB, which is a database. Most people use the mongoose library with MongoDB, so as to help them in structuring the way data is sent and received from the backend.
   - Express  - It is a JavaScript Library which simplifies the process of making a server.
   - React    - Library used to design the front end.   
   - Node.js  - Library to run javascript code.
  
    One nice thing about the Tutorial was it taught how to use a cluster on the cloud to store all your data.
    
    **Important** to note that there is an [updated version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrHNSanmqQ4) of the tutorial, maybe you can check that out.
